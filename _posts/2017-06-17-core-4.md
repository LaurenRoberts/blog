Programming - Core 4:
What is a variable? (and how do you do it in Ruby) a word or letter that stores
some information, ex. var x = 52;
What is a function? (and how do you do it in Ruby) A chunk of code that can be reused,
def countup(x)
x ++;
end
What is a conditional? (and how do you do it in Ruby) if X = 52 than do Y, if x = 52

What is a loop? (and how do you do it in Ruby) telling the comp "do this until the point I told you to stop"
while x>52 
code
end
