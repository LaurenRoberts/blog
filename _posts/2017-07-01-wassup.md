Object-Oriented Programming Core 4:
What is a Class? //A group of things that are usually related to one another somehow
What is an Object (and how is it different from a class)? //An object is a thing inside a class, it cannot hold other objects.
How do you create a Class and a new Object in Ruby? 
//class new_class
//end
// object = new_class.new
If you represent your database with Classes and Objects, what does the Class represent? //tables  What do the Objects represent? rows
